CSDN-GitChat-DL4j-Course-DLWeb

The project is a java web application. We train a fashion classification model based on fashion-mnist dataset and launch a web service integrated with tomcat. The users can upload a fashion related picture(e.g. shoe,shirt,trousers etc) and will get a recognition result.We train the model using Eclipse Deeplearning4j and Tomcat as web server.
